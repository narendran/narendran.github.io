My last technical blog was on [MongoDB vs. RethinkDB](https://ntvita.com/2015/06/04/mongo-vs-rethink.html) and it has been ~5 years since then!

Why the gap?

To reduce friction to both writing and reading this blog, I will try to keep the points concise and focus on the main takeaway.

# Differentiable Programming

**Why write programs that can be differentiated?**

1. Scientific Computing applications that directly use differentations.
2. Software 2.0 systems like Neural Networks.
3. [Thought experiment] Using differentiation as a first-class citizen in systems and applications.

# In Scientific Computing

# In Software 2.0

# Using Differentiation as a first-class programming primitive

# How to get started?
