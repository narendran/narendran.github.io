Summary:

## International

* Wars: The Russia-Ukraine and Israel-Hamas wars continue with no end in sight, but there are upcoming "checkpoints" where there could be opportunities to rethink its course. E.g. Russia has presidential elections in March, and we could expect a strong show of anti-war sentiment from Russian people. Similarly, though Israel is fully intended to completely destroy Hamas, there are incentives for Biden to request Israel to slow down -- which has already started happening this week.
* Potential Wars
  * Sadly, geopolitical tension continues to be high across the planet. Venezuela could start a land grab of Essequibo region (2/3rd of Guyana to the west of the Essequibo river). North Korea could continue testing nuclear weapons, however there is no clear reason for a war, both from North Korea's perspective or from the South Korean alliance perspective -- so this should continue to be nuclear weapons testing and "defense" narratives with occasional show of offense from North Korea side. Then there is a potential Sino-Indian war across the Line of Actual Control which spans from Himalayas to Arunachal Pradesh -- Aksai Chin, AP are places where the Chinese occupy areas where India is recognized by international borders. China is already putting a lot of pressure on Taiwan, and with US being focused on war support on at least two other fronts (Ukraine and Middle-East), this could be an opening for China.
* Upcoming major elections
  * UK 2024: After 14 years of Conservative party + 3 prime ministers in 2023 (Boris Johnson, Liz Truss and Rishi Sunak), the Labour party holds a strong 45% to 22% lead in the latest polls against the Conservatives. Ref: [Statista](https://www.statista.com/statistics/985764/voting-intention-in-the-uk/). Sir Keir Starmer from Labour party looks comfortable winning the next election.
  * USA 2024: If you don't follow US politics, there are two major parties in USA -- Democrats and Republicans -- and then there are Independents. Republican party \~usually stands for free enterprise and individual initiative (roughly mapping to capitalism) while Democratic party \~usually focuses on broader economic fairness and social issues (roughly mapping to social liberalism). Now, coming to the 2024 election, according to latest 538 polls, Biden is still strong at 68% among Democratic candidates, with the 71yo Marianne Williamson very distant and the only other democratic candidate. And among the Republican candidates, Donald Trump is continuing to gain ratings despite not showing up for presidential debates and stands at 62%, with Nikki Haley and Ron Desantis fighting for second position at 11% each. The next candidate is Vivek Ramaswamy who reached a peak rating of 11.6%, but has fallen to 4% at the moment.
* Climate Change: 2024 would be the first year where the world would be 1.5 degrees C hotter than pre-industrial temperatures, which is a (worrying) milestone in climate change history. The Paris Agreement of 2015 is to limit global average temperature this century to below 2 degrees C.

## US

* California has lost 538K of its population since 2020, which is \~1.4% of its population. [Macrotrends](https://www.macrotrends.net/states/california/population#:~:text=The%20population%20of%20California%20in,a%200.17%25%20increase%20from%202019.). With about 39M residents out of the \~336M people in the USA, 11.6% of USA lives in California, followed by Texas holding 30M residents and Florida holding 22.6M residents.
