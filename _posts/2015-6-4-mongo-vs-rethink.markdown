As a grad student, a lot of my projects do not have a specific format in which they proceed. So the schema of the data almost always changes with time. Secondly, I always have some kind of data collection and analytics happening so having a database that provides good support for aggregation queries with very high write speed would work best for me. Ever since mongoDB was released, I have always used it for all my projects. But nowadays, I have started seeing a lot of blog posts which complain about the performance of mongoDB. So I set out to find the truth on my own. This time, I have taken RethinkDB to compare mongoDB with because, I like the ReQL language a lot.
