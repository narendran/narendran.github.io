# World
* King Charles diagnosed with cancer.
* Wildfires in Valparaiso and Puerto Montt areas in Chile, death toll reaches 123.
* Israel-Hamas war: Started in Oct 7, 2023 by Hamas, followed by a significant retaliation by Israel. US is heavily involved: Drone attack in Jordan killed 3 US troops, US responds with airstrikes in Iraq, while continuing military operations in Yemen against Houthi forces. Latest: There is an international proposal to reduce intensity and exchanges hostages, waiting on Hamas response ([link](https://apnews.com/article/israel-hamas-war-live-updates-2-2-2024-c2c089f9c0aa82a613a011fba36f46c4)). Current death toll is 1139 on Israel side, and 27,585 on Gaza side.
  * Why are Houthis involved? Ideological alignment with Hamas and backing by Iran. Note that Iran has built such military groups across Yemen, Lebanon, Iraq, and Syria.
  * Why are US and UK reacting? Because the disruption of ships passing the Red Sea will affect global shipping and commerce.
* Proposal on category 6 hurricanes.

# USA

* Elections (Jan 15, Sep 10): Presidential nominations on-going across the US states, looks like Trump vs. Biden so far.

# General
* Concept of power distance from Dutch social psychologist Geert Hofstede, shows *High* and *Low* Power Distance cultures. When power distance is high, there is a great dereference to a person of authority (e.g. China, India, Malaysia, Philippines, Mexico), and when low there is equal treatment of everyone (e.g. Denmark, Sweden, New Zealand).
