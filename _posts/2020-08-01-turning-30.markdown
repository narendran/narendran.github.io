Today, I turn 30.

# Thousands of decisions and their consequences

Turning 30 marks a significant milestone in your life. It marks the end of the first decade of a completely independent life. At this point, you have made thousands of decisions large and small ranging from yourself to your family to your career to the society at large. By 30, you've had a chance to see and respond to the consequences of thousands of decisions at this point. Imagine the sort of decisions we take every single day:

On Education and Work:
* Which university should I apply to?
* Got admits! Which one to go to?
* Should I get an education loan or see what luck has for me with on-campus jobs?
* Which team should I join for the group project?
* Everyone looks so cool and confident. What should I do to feel less awkward?
* Yay! Internship money! Should I spend it on traveling within USA or save it up for a visit to India?
* Should I get a 6" from Subway to look cool in front of my new friends or get a foot-long and secretly hide half of it for dinner?
* Which path should I take after graduation? Start a company/Small company/Large company/BigTech?
* Which shirt should I wear for that interview?
* Which of these opportunities promises a happy life and secure future?
* Do I need 2/1/0 external monitors?
* Its 9 am, check email or save my sanity?
* Should we hire X or not?
* Suggest this design or that?
* Attend this meeting or skip?
* Its 3pm, should I have a second coffee now?
* ...

On Personal Life:
* What should I cook for dinner tonight?
* Who should I watch the next Game of Thrones episode with?
* Which class do I try? Piano/Marathon training/Rock climbing/Tennis/Skiing/Swimming?
* What to do this weekend? Movie/Clubbing/Sleepover/Board Games/Birthday Party?
* Best friend is getting married! Vegas or Los Angeles for Bachelor Party?
* Should I get married?
* Wow, she looks good, could she be the One?
* Repeat previous question N times.
* Woohoo! I am getting married. Should I invite 10 people or 1000 people?
* Where should I go for a vacation this July 4th weekend?
* Skyscanner or Kayak?
* Canoe or Kayak?
* AirBnb or Holiday Inn? Car camping or RV?
* Is Top of the Rock worth the money?
* Should I get a pet?
* Should I have a kid?
* Which of the 8 different genetic tests do I want to take?
* Huggies or Pampers or Cloth diapers?
* Cocomelon or Word Party?
* Disney or Universal Studios or both?
* Should I sell the crib and donate all the baby clothes now?
* Should I have a second kid?
* Should I rent a bigger place then?
* OMG $3000! Should I consider buying a house now or will the market crash due to a second deadly wave of CoViD?
* Which school district do I want? GreatSchools rating >= 6/7/8/9/10?
* ...

On Day-to-Day Lifestyle:
* Should I buy that "Bay Area" hoodie?
* Do I need a car or can I survive on Uber?
* Which car to buy?
* Do I need to fill air today?
* Starbucks or Pete's?
* Almond milk or Soy milk?
* For-here or to-go?
* ...

Well, you get it. Note that I have not even touched upon areas like personal health, personal finance, etc. Hopefully you are convinced that I was not exaggerating about the "thousands of decisions". And these decisions, though simple and harmless in appearance, have significant repercussions. The decisions define who you are. This makes turning 30 very special.

Now, nobody really trains you for making these decisions. You sort of stumble upon them and figure these out on the way. By the time you are 30, you have automatic responses to almost all the above questions and spend your precious mental energy on the remaining new and exciting ones. No big deal, life moves on.

Here is yet-another-30-year old contemplating on the top two life lessons from a decade of independent decision making. That said, I have absolutely no regrets -- and I wouldn't go back to my 20yo self and share these lessons.

# Learning #1: Logic Fails

Logic fails in surprising ways.

Yes, you have lived for a long time now. You've amassed tons of personal and vicarious life experiences at this point. You have read voraciously and ensured your sources are verified and reliable. You are up-to-date on news. You know you are absolutely right. You articulate your points with impeccable logic backed by undeniable science and powerful anecdotes.

But you could still be wrong. Be open to be schooled.

  "Strong opinions, weakly held" -- Marc Andreesen
</div>

When I was 22, right out of undergrad schooling, I starkly remember the attitude I held while talking to older adults (read: mom and dad). I was thoroughly convinced that I knew more facts than them. I believed I had exponentially higher access to data and tools/people to make sense of it. I had read enough logical thinking and critical thinking books that at that point I felt "invincible". And each time I crushed an argument putting the other person out of words, the feedback I got only reinforced my convictions. As I grew older, I realized that I was so wrong. Turns out, each time the argument ended, the older adults had simply given up on me or punted the discussion to a later time.

So how do these "realizations" happen via "experience"? Let's make it concrete with an anecdote from my life.

**On Gold**

<div style="background-color:rgba(0, 0, 200, 0.1); vertical-align: middle; padding:20px; margin: 10px; border-radius: 15px; font-style: italic;">
  Me: "Dad, so have you sold Gold before?" <br />
  Dad: "Nope. In fact, I personally don't know anyone who ever did that." <br /><br />
  Me: "So where do I sell gold when I need to sell it?" br />
  Dad: "What do you mean? You NEVER, EVER sell your gold. You only keep buying it whenever you can." <br /><br />
  Me: "Wait, that simply does not make sense." <br />
  Dad: "I cannot imagine how you can think of SELLING gold! Don't even think of touching it."
</div>

And I simply couldn't fathom how I would have a chunk of My parents, as they usually do, would just accept the ridicule and move on to a different topic. In a few years, this topic vanished from our conversations. Then I witnessed something.. which I still couldn't believe.

There was a 30-something affluent, happy, young couple named Raj and Riya. They were happily wed for 4 years and had a beautiful 2 year old daughter. Things cannot get better. And then, suddenly Raj's behavior started changing rapidly with every passing day. He became short-tempered, was overreacting and a dreaded dementia started setting in. He was not open to treatments and started making blatant mistakes in his family business and investments. He made bigger mistakes to cover up smaller mistakes. And to everyone's horror, he was diagnosed with Alzheimer's. This had a huge impact on his confidence, and he resorted to gambling and other practices for acceptance. Before Riya could react, all their hard-earned money including their sprawling, coveted primary residence at the city center... simply gone. Riya finally made peace with the situation and moved out with their daughter to her parents' place and to start off a new life from scratch. Raj continued visiting her asking for more money to gamble. After being told off a few times, he stopped bothering her. And in a few days, we learnt that he was dead. Amid the devastation the family was going through, Riya was purging all their bank accounts to ensure it cannot be misused further. To her surprise, there was one account which was untouched... their safety deposit box with their.. Gold.

This experience, though second-hand, is so powerful to etch the importance of having an absolutely untouchable asset. An asset which can endure catastrophes in the human minds and protect the family. That is how you go from calling something BS based on pure logic to understanding and embracing the idea.

Following is a sample of ideologies which have morphed to different shapes in the last 10 years.

**On God**
<div style="font-style: italic; padding-left: 2em;">
  "I do not care if there is a God or not" <br /><br />
  "I seek scientific truth. Where is God? I do not see Him :D If there is no evidence, then God simply does not exist. The end." <br /><br />
  "You should watch the interviews by Richard Dawkins" <br /><br />
  "If there was a God, He wouldn't let his people suffer. Would He?"<br /><br />
  "Why do you have to bribe God in temples. Don't you understand this is just a business transaction at this point?" <br /><br />
  "I've never thought harm to an ant, why did he break my ankle and make me bed-ridden for months?"<br /><br />
  "The concept of God can blind people from looking further into the truth. Why do we want to encourage a generation of kids to grow up that way?!"<br /><br />
  "Ok, God applies to you. I do not need Him though. I won't scoff at people who need Him."<br /><br />
  "See, why do I need a God while science can/will fully explain the universe?" <br /><br />
  "Damn! I think I get it. I will shut up now."
</div>
<br /><br />

**On problem solving**



Of course, this is not the exhaustive list where logic has failed. I've made embarrassing blunders being logically right in various walks of life including . As you grow older you will gradually build a categorized understanding of when all logic can fail. The top 2 categories that come to my mind are the following.
1. Deep-seated beliefs: When someone has lived a substantial part of their lives guided by a deep-seated belief, you cannot take them out of it. They could feel that we are nullifying a significant part of their life experiences by doing that. Once you convince yourself that life is about co-thriving happily more than being "right" in some contrived sense of it, your logic will start taking a back-seat when appropriate.
2. Longevity of human life: Some personal problems take **years** to fix. Yes, you read it right, YEARS. But depending on the thing or person you are changing, this is completely worth the effort.

# Learning #2: Embrace Grey

Most choices you see in life are not black and white. If they are, and you are still confused, talk to a buddy, get a cup of coffee or.. simply go to sleep and decide the next day.

**Views on science vs. spirituality**

I had written a similar blog about [turning 20](https://narnicles.wordpress.com/2011/09/04/life-lessons-what-i-learnt-from-my-20-year-experience-on-earth/). Besides the difference in writing style, you can clearly see the difference in my attitude between now and then on these two aspects -- being open and embracing Grey.

So, get comfortable with grey. There are easily more than 50 shades of grey. But start with 1.
