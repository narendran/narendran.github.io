Following is a continuous log of my notes and thoughts on how to think about personal finance and investments, and the different factors that play into it. I am based out of USA, so expect a strong bias towards economic indicators from USA.

# My main indicators

* Jobs
* Industry indices: DOW JONES
* US GDP: 3.3% QoQ growth while the expectations were at 2%.
