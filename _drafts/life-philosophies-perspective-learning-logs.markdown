* "If you only read the books that everyone else is reading, you can only think what everyone else is thinking." - Haruki Murakami's Norwegian Wood.
* [Pace Layering](https://jods.mitpress.mit.edu/pub/issue3-brand/release/2?utm_source=substack&utm_medium=email): How complex systems are built to be strong and flexible at the same time? The contradicting properties are coming from different layers of the system. The velocity comes from the outermost, high-speed, highly-flexible layer and the stability comes from the lower layers. For a single human being, I would say this ultimately comes from values and experiences -- which form convictions -- which leads to decisions in 2-3 layers. **What is important to understand is that, what we do at the outermost layer has meaningful impact on the inner layers over time.** Hence the importance of actively focusing on what we do everyday -- its noise if it happens one day, its a pattern and makes L-1 layer changes with sustained practice. With time, it could compromise the fundamental value system layers.
* On pace layering, a very good quote about how human beings coming into existence is on layers of time scale: *"The destiny of our species is shaped by the imperatives of survival on six distinct time scales. To survive means to compete successfully on all six time scales. But the unit of survival is different at each of the six time scales.
  * On a time scale of years, the unit is the individual.
  * On a time scale of decades, the unit is the family.
  * On a time scale of centuries, the unit is the tribe or nation.
  * On a time scale of millennia, the unit is the culture.
  * On a time scale of tens of millennia, the unit is the species.
  * On a time scale of eons, the unit is the whole web of life on our planet.
  Every human being is the product of adaptation to the demands of all six time scales. That is why conflicting loyalties are deep in our nature. In order to survive, we have needed to be loyal to ourselves, to our families, to our tribes, to our cultures, to our species, to our planet. If our psychological impulses are complicated, it is because they were shaped by complicated and conflicting demands"* -- Freeman Dyson

On the importance of systems, prioritization and focus:
* "Most of what we say and do is not essential. If you can eliminate it, you’ll have more time, and more tranquility. Ask yourself at every moment, **‘Is this necessary?’**" -- *Meditations* by Marcus Aurelius.
* "We are told that life is short and the art is long... It is not that we have a short time to live, but that we waste a lot of it. Life is long enough and a sufficiently generous amount of it has been given to us for the highest achievement if it were all well invested. When it is wasted in the heedless luxury and spent on no good activity, we are forced at last by death’s final constraint to realize that it has passed away before we knew it was passing. **So it is: we are not given a short life, but we make it short.** We are not ill supplied but wasteful of it. Just as when ample and princely wealth falls to a bad owner it is squandered in a moment, but wealth however modest, if entrusted to a good custodian, increases with use, so our lifetime extends amply if you manage it properly." -- *On the Shortness of Life: Life Is Long if You Know How to Use* It by Seneca
* "Goals are good for setting a direction but **systems are best for making progress**." -- James Clear
* "As soon as we control where awareness goes we control where energy flows. As soon as we control where energy is flowing we control what is manifesting in our life. And we need willpower and our powers of concentration to direct awareness." -- Unwavering Focus by Dandapani
