# Wars
* Wars:
  * The Russia-Ukraine and Israel-Hamas wars continue with no end in sight, but there are upcoming "checkpoints" where there could be opportunities to rethink its course. Russia has presidential elections in March, and we could expect a strong show of anti-war sentiment from Russian people. Similarly, though Israel is fully intent on completely destroying Hamas, there are incentives for Biden to request Israel to slow down -- which has already started happening this week.
  * Israel-Hamas war: Started in Oct 7, 2023 by Hamas, followed by a significant retaliation by Israel. Death toll as of Feb 2024 is 1139 on Israel side, and 27,585 on Gaza side. US is heavily involved: Why? Drone attack in Jordan killed 3 US troops, US responds with airstrikes in Iraq, while continuing military operations in Yemen against Houthi forces. Why are Houthis involved? Ideological alignment with Hamas and backing by Iran. Note that Iran has built such military groups across Yemen, Lebanon, Iraq, and Syria. Why are US and UK reacting? Because the disruption of ships passing the Red Sea will affect global shipping and commerce.
  * In Feb 2024, [$95B foreign funding](https://www.aljazeera.com/news/2024/2/13/us-senate-passes-long-delayed-bill-for-aid-to-ukraine-and-israel) bill passes Senate, split as $61B for Ukraine, $14B for Israel, $4.8B for Taiwan and $9B for humanitarian assistance in conflict zones. [EU is providing $54B](https://www.aljazeera.com/news/2024/2/1/european-union-agrees-on-new-54bn-aid-package-for-ukraine) in military funding to Ukraine. There is an international proposal to reduce intensity and exchanges hostages, waiting on Hamas response ([link](https://apnews.com/article/israel-hamas-war-live-updates-2-2-2024-c2c089f9c0aa82a613a011fba36f46c4)).

* Potentially New Wars
  * LATAM: Venezuela could start a land grab of Essequibo region (2/3rd of Guyana to the west of the Essequibo river).
  * APAC:
    * North Korea could continue testing nuclear weapons, however there is no clear reason for a war, both from North Korea's perspective or from the South Korean alliance perspective -- so this should continue to be nuclear weapons testing and "defense" narratives with occasional show of offense from North Korea side.
    * Then there is a potential Sino-Indian war across the Line of Actual Control which spans from Himalayas to Arunachal Pradesh -- Aksai Chin, AP are places where the Chinese occupy areas where India is recognized by international borders.
    * China is already putting a lot of pressure on Taiwan, and with US being focused on war support on at least two other fronts (Ukraine and Middle-East), this could be an opening for China.

# Important (to me) Elections
  * UK 2024: After 14 years of Conservative party + 3 prime ministers in 2023 (Boris Johnson, Liz Truss and Rishi Sunak), the Labour party holds a strong 45% to 22% lead in the latest polls against the Conservatives. Ref: [Statista](https://www.statista.com/statistics/985764/voting-intention-in-the-uk/). Sir Keir Starmer from Labour party looks comfortable winning the next election.
  * USA 2024: If you don't follow US politics, there are two major parties in USA -- Democrats and Republicans -- and then there are Independents. Republican party \~usually stands for free enterprise and individual initiative (roughly mapping to capitalism) while Democratic party \~usually focuses on broader economic fairness and social issues (roughly mapping to social liberalism). Now, coming to the 2024 election, according to 538 polls in Jan 2024, Biden is still strong at 68% among Democratic candidates, with the 71yo Marianne Williamson very distant and the only other democratic candidate. And among the Republican candidates, Donald Trump is continuing to gain ratings despite not showing up for presidential debates and stands at 62%, with Nikki Haley as the very distant competition.

# International
  * Intergovernmental organizations/blocs:
    * **BRICS**: BRICS was originally formed by Brazil, Russia, India and China in 2009, South Africa joined a year later in 2010. Big expansion in Jan 1, 2024 when Egypt, Ethipia, Iran, Saudi Arabia and UAE have joined. Argentina declined in early 2024.
  * **Petrodollar** at risk: In March 2023, Saudi Arabia started accepting Yuan for Chinese oil purchases, and then US countered with a deal for military protection and nuclear development in exchange for distancing Saudi from China. Note, the connection with strengthening BRICS above.

# Medicines

* **ADHD**: Adderall used to treat ADHD, 41.4M prescriptions in 2021 -- projecting to be ~60M now. So close to 1 in 5 people in US.
* **Sleep**: Back in 2020, 8.4% of adults had used sleep medications according to National Center of Health Statistics report. So possibly 1 in 10 people use it now?
* **Weight loss**: We learnt that doctors have been prescribing Ozempic for weight loss since 2017 -- and it works by making you eat less sugar by mimicking a gut hormone called GLP-1 which tells your brain that you don't need more sugar, and also keeps the food in our stomach longer. The argument for obesity to be a disease is calling obesity "a matter of mismatched signals between the brain and body" and that Ozempic and similar GLP-1 mimicking drugs are the medicines for that disease. Other counterparts: Wegovy and Mounjaro. Previous attempts include Belviq, which was pulled back in 2020 due to increased cancer risk. Estimate of penetration: ~3M, or close to 1 in 100 people in USA.
